## Introduction

DeepID offers powerful tools to detect manipulated or AI-generated images using sophisticated machine learning models. With the DeepID SDK, you can submit images for analysis, monitor processing, and retrieve comprehensive reports. These reports include a variety of metrics and insights, such as:

- **Predictions:** Likelihood scores indicating whether an image is authentic or manipulated.
- **Generator Attribution:** Information about the AI generator or model that may have created the image.
- **Visual Manipulation Detection:** Heatmaps that highlight regions potentially altered by AI.
- **Contextual Image Description:** Narrative overviews describing the prominent elements and activities in the image.
- **Analytical Reasoning:** Detailed explanations outlining why an image is flagged, providing transparency to the detection process.

## Getting Started

### Setup and Installation

1. **Register for an API Key:**  
   Sign up for a DeepID account at the designated registration page to obtain your unique API key. This key is used to authenticate all requests to the DeepID API and SDK.

2. **Install the DeepID SDK:**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed. After receiving your API key, install the DeepID SDK and configure your environment accordingly.

### Workflow Overview

- **File Submission:**  
  An image is submitted for analysis using an asynchronous processing method. The SDK sends the image file along with a modality indicator (set to “image”) and returns a unique job identifier.

- **Polling for Results:**  
  The image processing status is polled repeatedly until the analysis completes. The system waits for a configured duration between checks until the file status is updated to either "PROCESSED" or "RESULTS."

- **Retrieving and Saving Results:**  
  Once processing is complete, the SDK returns a detailed JSON report containing all relevant detection metrics. This report is saved locally for further examination or integration into your systems.

## Detailed Feature Usage for Images

The latest release of the DeepID SDK introduces several enhancements designed to provide deeper insights into image authenticity:

- **Comprehensive File Data Reporting:**  
  Aggregates all available analysis metrics into one detailed report. It consolidates predictions, generator attribution, visual heatmaps, descriptions, and reasoning explanations for thorough evaluation.

- **Generator Attribution:**  
  Identifies the AI model or generator behind a manipulated image, offering critical insight into the source of the content and essential for tracing and verifying deepfakes.

- **Visual Manipulation Detection:**  
  Generates visual heatmaps that pinpoint regions within an image exhibiting signs of manipulation. These heatmaps use visual cues to highlight areas with potential AI intervention.

- **Contextual Image Description:**  
  Provides a narrative overview of the key elements within an image, aiding in understanding the overall context and identifying any unusual or unexpected details.

- **Analytical Reasoning:**  
  Offers logic-based explanations detailing why an image was flagged as manipulated. This reasoning enhances transparency in the detection process and supports informed decision-making.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Secure Your API Key:**  
  Always protect your API key by using environment variables or secure configuration files. Avoid embedding your key in public repositories.

- **File Quality:**  
  For optimal results, use high-quality, uncompressed images. While higher quality files may require slightly longer processing times, they often lead to more accurate detection.

- **Efficient Polling:**  
  Adjust settings such as the number of retries and delay between checks based on your network speed and image file size. This ensures an optimized workflow and a responsive application.

- **Leverage New Features:**  
  Utilize advanced capabilities like comprehensive data reporting, heatmaps, and analytical reasoning to gain deeper insights into your image analysis. These features help interpret the results and improve decision-making.

- **Monitor API Usage:**  
  Regularly review your API usage statistics to ensure you remain within your allocated limits. Efficient usage monitoring can help optimize performance and prevent service interruptions.

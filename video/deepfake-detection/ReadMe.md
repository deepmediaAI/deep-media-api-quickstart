## Introduction

DeepID leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to detect manipulated or AI-generated video content. With the DeepID SDK, you can submit video files for analysis, monitor processing status, and retrieve comprehensive reports containing critical detection metrics. These reports provide valuable insights into video authenticity through:

- **Predictions:** Confidence scores indicating the likelihood that a video has been manipulated.
- **Generator Attribution:** Information on the AI model or generator potentially responsible for the video's creation.
- **Visual Analysis:** Insights that may include scene-level evaluations and temporal consistency checks.
- **Contextual Video Description:** Summaries that capture the overall narrative and key activities within the video.
- **Analytical Reasoning:** Explanations outlining why a video was flagged, providing clarity and supporting informed decision-making.

## Getting Started

### Setup and Installation

1. **Register for an API Key:**  
   Sign up for a DeepID account at the designated registration page to obtain your unique API key. This key is required to authenticate all interactions with the DeepID API and SDK.

2. **Install the DeepID SDK:**  
   After obtaining your API key, ensure that you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. Install the DeepID SDK and configure your environment with the appropriate settings (e.g., staging or production) to ensure secure and efficient API communication.

### Workflow Overview

- **File Submission:**  
  A video file is submitted for asynchronous analysis. The SDK sends the video file along with a modality indicator (set to “video”) and returns a unique job identifier.

- **Polling for Results:**  
  The SDK enables your application to poll for the processing status using the job ID. The process involves waiting a configured interval between checks until the status updates to either "PROCESSED" or "RESULTS."

- **Retrieving and Saving Results:**  
  Upon completion of processing, the SDK returns a detailed JSON report with all detection metrics. This report is saved locally for further analysis or integration into your existing workflows.

## Detailed Feature Usage for Videos

The latest release of the DeepID SDK introduces several enhancements to improve video analysis capabilities:

- **Comprehensive File Data Reporting:**  
  Aggregates all available analysis metrics for a video into one detailed report. It includes predictions, attribution details, and scene-level analysis, providing a full overview of the video’s authenticity.

- **Generator Attribution:**  
  Identifies the AI model or generator that may have produced the video content. This feature is essential for tracing the source of manipulated content and verifying its authenticity.

- **Temporal and Visual Analysis:**  
  Advanced processing techniques assess the video’s temporal consistency and scene transitions. This helps identify subtle manipulations that might be present across different video frames.

- **Contextual Video Description:**  
  Generates a narrative summary describing the overall content, key activities, and notable scenes within the video. This description enhances understanding of the video context and highlights potential issues.

- **Analytical Reasoning:**  
  Provides detailed explanations outlining why the video was flagged as potentially manipulated. This reasoning supports transparency and aids in interpreting the detection results.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Secure Your API Key:**  
  Protect your API key by using environment variables or secure configuration files. Avoid embedding your key directly in public repositories or shared code.

- **File Quality:**  
  For optimal results, use high-quality video files. Although larger and higher quality files may take longer to process, they often yield more accurate detection outcomes.

- **Efficient Polling:**  
  Adjust polling settings such as the number of retries and delay between checks to suit your network conditions and video file sizes. This ensures a responsive and efficient workflow.

- **Leverage Advanced Features:**  
  Take advantage of comprehensive reporting, temporal analysis, and analytical reasoning features to gain deeper insights into your video content. These features enhance the overall detection process and provide actionable data.

- **Monitor API Usage:**  
  Regularly review your API usage statistics to ensure you remain within your allocated limits. Efficient usage monitoring helps optimize performance and prevent service interruptions.

## Introduction

DeepID leverages cutting-edge machine learning models to detect manipulated or AI-generated audio content. With the DeepID SDK, you can submit audio files for analysis, monitor their processing status, and retrieve comprehensive reports that include critical detection metrics. These reports provide valuable insights into the authenticity of your audio, such as:

- **Predictions:** Confidence scores indicating the likelihood that an audio file has been manipulated.
- **Generator Attribution:** Information identifying which AI model or generator may have produced the audio content.
- **Acoustic Anomaly Detection:** Analysis of audio patterns to reveal potential manipulations or inconsistencies.
- **Contextual Audio Description:** Summaries of prominent sounds or speech elements within the file.
- **Analytical Reasoning:** Detailed explanations that outline why the audio was flagged, increasing transparency and aiding in the decision-making process.

## Getting Started

### Setup and Installation

1. **Register for an API Key:**  
   Sign up for a DeepID account at our [registration page](https://staging.api.deepidentify.ai/docs/) to obtain your unique API key. This key is essential for authenticating all requests through the DeepID API and SDK.

2. **Install the DeepID SDK:**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. Then, install the DeepID SDK by running the following command in your terminal:
   
   pip install deepid

   Configure the SDK in your environment as needed.

### Workflow Overview

- **File Submission:**  
  Submit an audio file for asynchronous analysis by sending it along with the modality indicator (set to “audio”). The system returns a unique job identifier.

- **Polling for Results:**  
  Use the SDK to poll for the processing status with the job ID. The system waits for a configured duration between status checks until the file's status is updated to either "PROCESSED" or "RESULTS."

- **Retrieving and Saving Results:**  
  Once processing is complete, the SDK returns a detailed JSON report encompassing all detection metrics. This report is saved locally for further analysis or integration into your workflow.

## Detailed Feature Usage for Audio

The latest release of the DeepID SDK introduces several enhancements specifically for audio analysis:

- **Comprehensive File Data Reporting:**  
  Consolidates all available audio analysis metrics into a single report, combining predictions, attribution data, and additional audio-specific insights for a full overview of the analysis.

- **Generator Attribution:**  
  Identifies the AI model or generator responsible for creating the audio content. This feature is crucial for tracing the origins of manipulated audio and verifying its authenticity.

- **Acoustic Anomaly Detection:**  
  Analyzes audio patterns to detect irregularities or unusual artifacts that may indicate manipulation. This helps identify anomalies in the frequency, amplitude, or temporal structure of the audio.

- **Contextual Audio Description:**  
  Generates a narrative summary of the audio content, highlighting key sounds, speech elements, and other notable audio cues. This description aids in understanding the context and potential issues within the audio file.

- **Analytical Reasoning:**  
  Provides detailed explanations of the factors contributing to the detection outcome. This reasoning clarifies why the audio was flagged as potentially manipulated, enhancing trust in the detection results.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Secure Your API Key:**  
  Always protect your API key by using environment variables or secure configuration files. Avoid embedding your key directly in publicly shared code.

- **File Quality:**  
  For optimal results, use high-quality, uncompressed audio files. While higher quality audio can lead to more precise detection, it may also increase processing times.

- **Efficient Polling:**  
  Configure your polling settings—such as the number of retries and delay between checks—based on your network conditions and audio file size. This ensures an optimized and responsive workflow.

- **Leverage Advanced Features:**  
  Utilize comprehensive reporting, acoustic anomaly detection, and analytical reasoning to gain deeper insights into your audio analysis. These features are essential for a thorough understanding of detection outcomes.

- **Monitor API Usage:**  
  Regularly review your API usage statistics to ensure you remain within your allocated limits. Efficient usage monitoring helps optimize performance and avoid service interruptions.
